Co-Investigator: Jacs Scheinman, MGH Institute of Health Professions, jscheinman@mghihp.edu, 847-910-3662

You are invited to participate in a research project focused on understanding and improving gender-affirming care in dietetics education. This project is led by researchers committed to enhancing educational inclusivity and competence in nutrition and dietetics. 

Participation involves completing a mixed-methods survey that will help us understand your perspective on the inclusion of gender-affirming care, identify curricular gaps, and document any barriers you may have encountered. The survey can be completed electronically via REDcap at your convenience, and it will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.
We deeply value your contribution to this important work. Your involvement will not only influence the direction of our research but also potentially impact future dietetic education and practice, ensuring a more inclusive healthcare environment for transgender and gender diverse individuals.

Confidentiality: Your responses will be kept confidential. Data will be stored securely in the Partners/MGB REDcap system or on Partners/MGB-issued computers.
Risks and Benefits: This study poses minimal risk. Benefits include contributing to a more inclusive and effective dietetics curriculum.
Voluntary Participation: Participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without penalty.
